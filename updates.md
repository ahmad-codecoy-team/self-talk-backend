1. include a new field Last Access (last login / last activity timestamp) in our 'src/models/User.js'. working is when user first time logs in, this field will store current timestamp. same for whenever later user logs in again. but also when frontend hits "/api/user/profile" it should first update this field and then only sends the response including this new field as well. now the user endpoints under admin routes,"GET /api/admin/users" this admin endpoint should also return this new field.

2. add a new api endpoint under '/api/admin/users'. what it will do is to delete that user's elven lab data including his voice id and model id. for this checkout 'src/controllers/userController/deleteAcoount" controller function. there we are deleting user's elevenlabs data by calling 2 apis, here you need to do exact thing. so after that user "voice_id" and "model_id" will be back to null. make sure here in this new admin route we are just deleting users elevenlabs data nothing else.

3. add another enpoint again under '/api/admin/users'. this is for bulk action. using this endpoint, admin should be able to suspend/unsuspend or delete multiple users at a time. so here suspend/unsuspend is same like in current "/api/admin/users/suspension" but just for multiple users. and here delete user is same like in current "/api/user/delete-account" here deleting multiple users.
